Created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This makes setting up a React project a breeze. The boilerplate files and code were removed to reduce this project's assets.

## Task

### Description

Create a form that displays three input fields: Username, password, and confirm password. Add a simple input validation for the password fields, alerting them when the fields do not match. Please DO NOT use Redux or any other third party libraries other than ReactJS and JavaScript. Make sure the state of the input fields entries persists.

### Acceptance criteria

As a user, I should:

- see a form with three input fields: Username, password, and confirm password
- be alerted if I enter passwords that do not match

## Setup

Please have Node >= 14 on your local machine.

Install the required packages by running:

`npm install`

Start the app by running:

`npm start`
